# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Project Name:
**Player Selection App**

### Brief Description:
This is a **React**-based player selection application where users can select players within a budget. Users can add balance to their account and manage their selected player list. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and managing preferred players.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As a fast development and build tool.
- **React Toastify**: For displaying toast notifications based on user actions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and design.

### 3 Key Features:
1. **Balance Management**: Users can easily add a fixed amount to their balance and automatically deduct from it when selecting players.
  
2. **Player Selection with Limit**: Users can select up to 6 players, with notifications if they try to exceed this limit or if they lack sufficient balance.

3. **Dynamic Feedback**: Users receive toast notifications based on their actions, such as successful player selections or warnings when their balance is low.
